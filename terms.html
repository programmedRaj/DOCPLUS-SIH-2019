                        <br><br>
                        <b>RELATIONSHIPS</b><br><br>
A.  Employer and Freelancer.
(1) Project Agreement. The engagement, contracting and management of a
project are between an Employer and a Freelancer. Upon acceptance of a
quote, the Employer agrees to get his work done, and the Freelancer agrees
to deliver, the services and related deliverables in accordance with the
following agreements: (a) the agreement between Employer and Freelancer
including the Project Bid, Project Description, and other terms and conditions
as communicated between Employer and Freelancer on the Website or
otherwise, (b) these Terms of Service, and (c) any other content uploaded to
the Website by either party (collectively, the “Project Agreement”). You agree
not to enter into any contractual provisions in conflict with these Terms of
Service. Any provision of a Project Agreement in conflict with these Terms of
Service is void. Employer is responsible for managing, inspecting, accepting
and paying for satisfactory services and deliverables in accordance with the
Project Agreement in a timely manner. Freelancer is responsible for the
performance and quality of the services in accordance with the Project
Agreement in a timely manner. Employer and Freelancer each covenants and
agrees to act with good faith and fair dealing in performance of the Project
Agreement.
(2) Independence. Employer and Freelancer each acknowledges and agrees

that their relationship is that of independent contractors. The Freelancer shall
perform services as an independent contractor and nothing in these Terms of
Service shall be deemed to create a partnership, joint venture, agency, or
employer-employee relationship between Freelancer and Employer or
between Workies.in and any Employer or Freelancer.<br><br>
B. Registered Users and Workies.in.
(1) General. Workies.in is not a party to the dealing, contracting and
fulfillment of any Project between an Employer and a Freelancer. Workies.in
has no control over and does not guarantee the quality, safety or legality of
any services performed or deliverables created, advertised, the truth or
accuracy of project listings, the qualifications, background, or abilities of
Registered Users, the ability of Freelancers to perform services, the ability of
Employers to pay for services, or that an Employer or Freelancer can or will
actually complete a Project. Workies.in is not responsible for and will not
control the manner in which a Freelancer operates and is not involved in the
hiring, firing, discipline or working conditions of the Freelancer. All rights and
obligations for the purchase and sale of services or other deliverables are
solely between an Employer and a Freelancer. Workies.in will not provide any
Freelancer with any materials or tools to complete any Project. Employers
and Freelancers must look solely to the other for enforcement and
performance of all the rights and obligations arising from Project Agreements
and any other terms, conditions, representations, or warranties associated
with such dealings.Workies.in will not be held responsible in case of any
disputes between freelancers or employers or companies.
(2) Third-Party Beneficiary of Project Agreement. Employer and Freelancer
each acknowledges and agrees that the value, reputation, and goodwill of the
Website depend on their performance of their covenants and agreements as
set forth in their Project Agreement. Employer and Freelancer therefore
appoint Workies.in as a third-party beneficiary of their Project Agreement for
purposes of enforcing the obligations owed to, and the benefits conferred on,
Workies.in by these Terms of Service. Employers and Freelancers further
agree that Workies.in has the right to take such actions with respect to the
Project Agreement or their Accounts, including without limitation, suspension,

termination, or any other legal actions, as Workies.in in its sole discretion
deems necessary to protect the value, reputation, and goodwill of the
Website.
(3) Agency. These Terms of Service and any registration for or subsequent
use of this Website by any user or Registered User will not be construed as
creating or implying any relationship of agency, franchise, partnership or joint
venture between you and Workies.in, except and solely to the extent
expressly stated.
(4) Escrow Disputes. If an Employer or Freelancer reasonably disputes the
quality or completion of services provided by such Freelancer, then both
Employer and Freelancer agree that Workies.in shall have no payment
obligations to any party related to relevant fees until such dispute is resolved
in accordance with Section 6 below. Workies.in’s obligation to pay any
Payment (less applicable Service Charge) is expressly conditioned upon
resolution of all outstanding disputes with respect to such Payment.
(5) Currency. The Workies.in Billing and Payment Services operate in INR
and therefore Workies.in is not responsible for currency fluctuations that
occur when billing or crediting a credit or debit card denominated in a
currency other than INR, nor is Workies.in responsible for currency
fluctuations that occur.<br><br>

providing legal services to you, (2) Workies.in will not advise you regarding

any legal matters and (3) if you desire to have legal counsel, you will seek
independent legal counsel licensed to practice law in your jurisdiction and not
rely on Workies.in for any such counsel. You agree to indemnify and hold
harmless Workies.in and any of our affiliates against any damages or liability
you may suffer as a result of using the Dispute Resolution Service. If you do
not agree to use this Dispute Resolution Service under these terms, you
